Welcome to Version Control with Git!

We hope that you will enjoy the course, be challenged by it and learn a lot. The primary objective is to build a strong foundational knowledge of the Git version control system. This will provide you the ability to work with Git with confidence, and the ability to dive deeper into any aspect of Git that interests you.

It is suggested that you go through the course at a pace that makes sense for you. The topics build on each other, so it is better to slow down and really learn something than to just move on in order to keep up a certain pace. Use the forums or ask someone who knows Git for help you if you are stuck.

You can view the course videos on your phone, but the hands-on labs require a Mac, Windows or Linux computer. The hands-on labs are a key component of the course, reinforcing the material discussed in the video and providing you with real experience with Git.

Good luck with the course!
